# Tmdb Movies
A movie discovery app that fetches popular movies from the TMDB API, allowing users to 
manage their favorite movies and view detailed information when they interact with a specific movie.

This project is designed with a focus on clean architecture principles, utilizing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to ensure a clear separation of concerns and maintainable code structure.

## Android Libraries and Frameworks used:

- [Compose](https://example.com](https://developer.android.com/compose)) declarative UI framework
- Coroutines and Flow for async operations
- Retrofit for networking
- Hilt for dependency injection
- Coil for image loading
- RoomDB for local data storage
- Jetpack
  - Navigation for navigation between composables
  - ViewModel that stores, exposes and manages UI state
  - LiveData
- Single activity architecture (with Navigation component)
- MVVM for presentation layer
