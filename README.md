# Tmdb Movies
A movie discovery app that fetches popular movies from the TMDB API, allowing users to 
manage their favorite movies and view detailed information when they interact with a specific movie.

This project is designed with a focus on clean architecture principles, utilizing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to ensure a clear separation of concerns and maintainable code structure.
